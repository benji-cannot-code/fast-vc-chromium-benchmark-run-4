# Chrome Design System Project Knowledge

## Read reference files

Start from the `agents/projects/chrome-design-system/` directory and use glob to find relevant files.

- For token mappings, read `assets/tokens.md`.
- For component specs or to map components between Figma and code, read `assets/component-specs/*`.
  - Use `list_directory` tool on this path to find the relevant `_Spec.md` files.

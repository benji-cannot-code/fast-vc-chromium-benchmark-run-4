# platform/loader directories

This document describes how files under platform/loader are organized.

## fetch

Contains files for low-level loading APIs.  PLAYFORM_EXPORT is needed to use
them from core/.  Otherwise they can be used only in platform/.

## testing

Contains helper files for testing that are available in both
blink_platform_unittests and webkit_unit_tests.
These files are built as a part of the platform test_support static library.

Because this test suite is run as a virtual suite and it's quite deep in the
folders, we have to use abbreviations for the test names to not run over 200
characters, which is problematic on Windows.

* unspecified -> "u"
* unsafe-none -> "un"
* same-origin -> "so"
* same-origin-allow-popups -> "soap"
* restrict-properties -> omitted

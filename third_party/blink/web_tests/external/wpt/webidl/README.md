Tests for the [Web IDL Standard](https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/).

== Syntax tests ==

Syntax tests can be found in the "valid" and "invalid" directories.

These are syntax tests for a Web IDL parser. A correct parser should fail on the tests in the "invalid" directory, and should be able to collect the data necessary to generate the XML serialization for valid fragments collected in the "valid" directory.

(The said XML serialization is the one produced by [widlproc](https://github.com/dontcallmedom/widlproc) from which these tests have been imported.)

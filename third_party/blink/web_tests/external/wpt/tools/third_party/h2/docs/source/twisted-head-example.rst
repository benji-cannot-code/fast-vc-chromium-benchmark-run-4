Twisted Example Client: Head Requests
=====================================

This example is a basic HTTP/2 client written for the `Twisted`_ asynchronous
networking framework.

This client is fairly simple: it makes a hard-coded HEAD request to
nghttp2.org/httpbin/ and prints out the response data. Its purpose is to demonstrate
how to write a very basic HTTP/2 client implementation.

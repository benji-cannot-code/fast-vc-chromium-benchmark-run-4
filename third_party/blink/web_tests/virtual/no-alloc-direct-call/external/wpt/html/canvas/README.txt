This suite runs the tests in web_tests/external/wpt/html/canvas with the
--enable-fake-no-alloc-direct-call-for-testing flag. Test crashes that are
specific to this suite are most likely caused by forbidden V8 allocations or
JavaScript execution within the scopes of calls to blink APIs that have the
[NoAllocDirectCall] extended IDL attribute.

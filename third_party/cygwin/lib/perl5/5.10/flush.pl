# This library is no longer being maintained, and is included for backward
# compatibility with Perl 4 programs which may require it.

# In particular, this should not be used as an example of modern Perl
# programming techniques.

# Suggested alternative: IO::Handle

;# Usage: &flush(FILEHANDLE)
;# flushes the named filehandle

;# Usage: &printflush(FILEHANDLE, "prompt: ")
;# prints arguments and flushes filehandle

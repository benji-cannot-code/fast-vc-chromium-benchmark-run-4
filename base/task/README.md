FASTVC-BENCH-CORPUS:chromium-main-v1-943b94ae-1c74-4335-94fa-ceb4d277cea8
This directory has the following layout (WIP):
- base/task/: public APIs for posting tasks and managing task queues.
- base/task/task_scheduler/: implementation of the TaskScheduler.
- base/task/sequence_manager/: implementation of the SequenceManager.

Apart from embedders explicitly managing a TaskScheduler and/or SequenceManager
instance(s) for their process/threads, the vast majority of users should only
need APIs in base/task/.

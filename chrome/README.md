# Chrome

This directory contains the open source, application layer of Google Chrome.

Unlike other parts of Chromium like //content, which provide framework intended
to support multiple products, this directory contains code that is focused on
building specific products with opinionated UX.

Specific products include:
- Chrome desktop browser for Chrome OS, Windows, Mac and Linux
- Chrome mobile browser for Android
- Chrome OS system UI

See //ios for the Chrome mobile browser for iOS, and note that code that is
shared between //chrome and //ios is typically factored out into //components.

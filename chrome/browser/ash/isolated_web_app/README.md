# Blink extensions for Isolated Web Apps in ChromeOS

This directory is the browser counterpart to the Blink extensions defined in
`//third_party/blink/renderer/extensions/chromeos/isolated_web_app`.

It only hosts browser tests to verify the functionality of these extensions. The
implementation of the APIs lives in
`//chromeos/ash/experiences/isolated_web_app`.

The only API available currently is `chromeos.isolatedWebApp.setShape`.

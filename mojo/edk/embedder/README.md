Mojo Embedder API
=================

The Mojo Embedder API is an unstable, internal API to the Mojo system
implementation. It should be used by code running on top of the system-level
APIs to set up the Mojo environment (instead of directly instantiating things
from src/mojo/edk/system).

Example uses: Service Manager, to set up the Mojo environment for Services;
Chromium code, to set up the Mojo IPC system for use between processes. Note
that most code should use the Mojo Public API (under src/mojo/public) instead.
The Embedder API should only be used to initialize the environment, set up the
initial MessagePipe between two processes, etc.
